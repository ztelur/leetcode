/**
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.  //每个元素代表你能够跳的最大距离

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
//到达最后，并且使用最小的jumps数

For example:
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
